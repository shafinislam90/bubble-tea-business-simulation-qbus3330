# Bubble Tea Business Simulation â€“ QBUS3330 Assignment 2

Overview

This project was completed as part of the QBUS3330 Business Analytics course (Semester 2, 2024). The objective was to evaluate the profitability and risk of opening a new bubble tea shop in Haymarket, Sydney, using simulation and optimization techniques.

The analysis incorporates **Monte Carlo simulation**, **scenario modeling**, **sensitivity analysis**, and **risk optimization** with @RISK in Excel.

Project Objective

To simulate and analyze:
- Yearly sales, costs, and profits for a bubble tea shop
- The impact of demand disruption (e.g. COVID-style lockdowns)
- The effect of offering free deliveries
- Optimal delivery fee contribution to mitigate business losses

Key Analytical Techniques

- **Monte Carlo Simulation** (5,000+ iterations)
- **Triangular & Normal Distributions** modeling
- **Sensitivity Analysis** across lockdown probabilities
- **Risk Optimizer** to determine optimal delivery cost coverage
- @RISK for Excel â€“ simulation and optimization engine


Key Findings

- Peak season demand significantly boosts profits, but variability is high
- Lockdowns materially affect profitability due to reduced demand
- Covering delivery costs improves accessibility but affects margins
- Risk Optimizer helps balance between cost mitigation and risk tolerance


## ðŸ›  Tools & Technologies

- Excel
- @RISK (Palisade Decision Tools Suite)
- Probability Distributions
- Descriptive and Inferential Statistics
